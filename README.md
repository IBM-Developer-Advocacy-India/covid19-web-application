# Covid-19 Data Analytic Microservices Application with Kubernetes and OpenShift

We have seen a range data published on the impact of various parameters on the spread of covid-19, including population density, average number of people per household, ethnicity, weather data etc.
Have you ever wanted to run your own analytics on covid-19 data, and examine data sets in order to draw a particular conclusion? Or possibly evaluate a theory, that may or not may not be true. Such analytics could potentially shed light on the impacts of various factors, and you can apply them to a variety of problems.   
Maybe you'd like to see the impact of temperature and humidity on the spread of covid-19 in different countries?  

This is a multipart workshop series on building,
deploying and managing microservices applications with Kubernetes and openshift.

Our application also comes with a frontend [User Interface](https://github.com/IBM-Developer-Advocacy-India/covid-19-ui) that connects to our parsers and invokes the API endpoints to display data and showcase the power of microservices running as conainers on Kubernetes and Openshift.  


This application has been designed as a template for designing your own analytical microservices and deploying onto Kubernetes.

Those Microservices are:

- Data Parser written in Java.
- UI frontend written in Java to generate HTML and Node.js.
- Analytical application wrtittn in Python Flask.  
- Data Visulization application written in Node.js  

We will be using the data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Let's start by clining the repos and packaging our Java application with Maven:

### Clone The Repositories
```
git clone github.com/IBM-Developer-Advocacy-India/covid19-web-application
git clone github.com/IBM-Developer-Advocacy-India/covid-19-ui
```
### Package Spring Boot with Maven

```bash
mvn clean install 
```
Run the jar file to test the Spring Boot application:
```bash
java -jar target/[filename].jar 
```
Data Parser runs on port 8082. if you want to change th *Port Number*, you need to edit ***"application.properties"*** file under src/main/java/resources/

```bash
curl http://localhost:8082 
```
Now we've ogot our application ready to be containerised with Docker. Before we dive deeper into Docker, let's explore what containers are and how docker fits in containerisation technology.

### Docker Image vs. Docker Container
> Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. (only interacting with designated resources)

> Container ****<ins>images become containers at runtime</ins>**** and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker.  

So let's get started and build our first container image with Docker. 
> The first step is to craft our dockerfile and the Dockerfile is essentially the build instructions to build the image. 



![alt text](https://github.com/mohaghighi/Covid19-Web-Application/raw/master/images/Labs/Slide36.png)
#### What is a Dockerfile?
A set of build instructions to build the image in a file called "dockerfile".  
#### Craft your Dockerfile
![alt text](https://github.com/mohaghighi/Covid19-Web-Application/raw/master/images/Labs/Slide40.png)



In the case of our Data Parser Spring Boot application: 
```
FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11:latest
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]

```
Dockerfile for Node.js application:
```
FROM node:12
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
ENTRYPOINT [”node",”app.js"]
```
Dockerfile for Python application:
```
FROM python:3
COPY package.py ./
RUN pip install pystrich
ENTRYPOINT [”python",”./app.py"]
```
save the file as <ins>dockerfile</ins> with no file extension.

### Building Docker Image from the Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t [image name:v1] [path]
```
in this case, let's call it myapp:v1
```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
```
let's take a look at our docker images: 
```
docker images
```
our image must be listed there.  
now let's a look at running containers: 
```
docker ps
```
if you add -al, you can view all running and stopped containers
```
docker ps -al 
```
Here's the command for running the docker container
```
docker run -p [PortHost:PortContainer] [imageName] -d --rm 
```
Now let's go ahead and run our container on port 8082:
```
docker run -p 8082:8082 myapp:v1 -d 
```
-d and --rm flags will respectively run the docker in detached, mode and replace an existing docker image of the same name with the name one.  
We can ping the application by invoking the /hello/ REST endpoint:
```
curl localhost:8082/hello/ 
```
#### Build and Run the UI App

The UI application can be retrieved from here:
<https://github.com/IBM-Developer-Advocacy-India/covid-19-ui>

Now let's build the UI app and call it myui:v1
Dockerfile is the same as the one we used for Data Parser app but changing the name to ***"myui"***
```bash
docker build -t myui:v1 .
```
> in case you haven't run the maven build and packaged the UI App, run this where mvnm file is located
```
mvn clean install 
```
Now let's run the UI app on port 8081:
```
docker run -p 8082:8082 myapp:v1 -d 
```
Open your browser and navigate to 
```
localhost:8081
```
From the UI, click on connect on the top left hand corner and enter:
```
http://localhost:8082
```

As you may have seen, you got an error indicating that the server is not responding. 
There reason is, we can connect to containers directly thorugh Docker, but docker containers cannot discover or comunicate with each other.
![alt text](https://github.com/mohaghighi/Covid19-Web-Application/raw/master/images/Labs/Slide45.png)

now let's try to ssh into our one of the docker containers and try to connect to the other one to identify the problem.
To simulate the issue that we've just expereinced with the UI app, let's ssh into our UI and try to connect to our data parser from within that container. 
![alt text](https://github.com/mohaghighi/Covid19-Web-Application/raw/master/images/Labs/Slide46.png)

```
docker exec [container name/ID] -it
```
Here how we ssh into UI app
```
docker exec -it myui:v1 /bin/bash 
```
Now let's connect from within the container and see if it works
```
curl localhost:8082/hello/ 
```
As you can see that doesn't work either.  
> containers need to be connected to the same network in order to communicate with each other

You can inspect your container to investigate the matter by looking for the network wihtin both containers.

```
docker inspect [container name]
```
As you can see our UI and Parser apps are not part of the same network. 
![alt text](https://github.com/mohaghighi/Covid19-Web-Application/raw/master/images/Labs/Slide48.png)

Let's create a network and instruct our containers to connect to it

```
docker network create test 
```

let's stop our docker containers:

```
docker stop [container id]
```

Let's run our containers again, this time instructing them to join the new network we've just created

```
docker run -p [PortHost:PortContainer] [imageName] --net=test
```

Run UI application on test network:

```
docker run -p 8081:8081 myui:v1 --net=test
```

Run parser application on test network:

```
docker run -p 8082:8082 myapp:v1 --net=test
```

Let's inspect our containers again and get their IP addresses based on thier new network

```
docker inspect [container name/ID]
```

if we try to ping our applications again, they should work fine.  
Go ahead and connect to the parser form the UI app to verify that. 

In the next part we will be using minikube to spin up a single node kubernetes cluster. If we build all our images on your host docker machine, it'd be quite difficult to transfer your images from your host into minikube.  
one solution is to use minikube's docker daemon to build your docker images.  
> you need to set your environmental parameter to use miinkube docker. This command will let you do that:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env) 
```
This step is not needed here, is intended to let you know what we will use minikube's docker.
